## Inspiration 

Madness Migrant is people focused. It's important to us that immigrants feel a sense of trust and belonging when using the app as well as meeting their needs. We chose to focus on mentor-ship, our app provides an opportunity for existing volunteers to be more involved as well as providing immigrants with a one on one personable experience.
